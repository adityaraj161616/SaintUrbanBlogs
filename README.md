## ‚ú® Advanced Horizontal Scroll

This project implements advanced horizontal scrolling for articles using GSAP's ScrollTrigger:

- Each `.horizontal` section contains a `.pin-wrap` and `.animation-wrap` with `.item` cards.
- As you scroll vertically, the section is pinned and the cards slide horizontally.
- Direction alternates with `.to-left` and `.to-right` classes.
- All logic is handled in `BlogList.tsx` and `utils/scrollAnimations.ts`.
